I am a Undergraduate student at the School of Microelectronic, South China University of Technology, advised by [Prof. Simei Yang](https://www2.scut.edu.cn/microelectronics/2020/0910/c25586a578837/page.htm).

My current research focuses on designing domain-specific vector processors to accelerate sparse-dense matrix multiplication (SpMM) for graph-structured workloads, emphasizing hardware-software co-design for handling irregular access patterns and power-law distributions.
